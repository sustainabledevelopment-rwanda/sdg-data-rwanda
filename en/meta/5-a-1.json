Moreover, a reference period is usually required in order to characterize the use of a specific area of agricultural land and identify subcategories. In particular, following the WCA 2020, agricultural land includes; \u2022 land under temporary crops, \u2022 land under temporary meadows and pastures, \u2022 land temporarily fallow, \u2022 land under permanent crops, \u2022 land under permanent meadows and pastures.</p><p>Agricultural population; Indicator 5.a.1 uses \u2018agricultural population\u2019 as denominator, instead of the total population, because tenure rights over agricultural land are relevant especially for individuals whose livelihood relies on agriculture. As a consequence, in the context of 5.a.1, the term \u2018agricultural population\u2019 has to be interpreted as equivalent of \u2018individuals engaged in agriculture\u2019.</p>Ownership and tenure rights over agricultural land; Land ownership is a legally recognised right to acquire, to use and to transfer land. In private property systems, this is a right akin to a freehold tenure. However, in systems where land is owned by the State, the term \u2018land ownership\u2019 refers to possession of the rights most akin to ownership in a private property system. In this context, it is more appropriate to speak of tenure rights.","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","computation_calculations":"(Number of households in agricultural population with ownership or tenure rights over agricultural land / otal agricultural household)* 100","computation_units":"Percent (%)","page_content":"","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-02-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/2681c507c601f652caf30eebd76f46acc23d97f0","goal_number":"5","target_number":"5.a","indicator":"5.a.1","sdg_goal":"5","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"05-0a-01"}
