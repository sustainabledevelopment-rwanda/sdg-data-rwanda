One of the targets is \u201cSubstantially increase the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020\u201d. In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, disaster risk reduction strategies and policies should mainstream and integrate disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors, across different timescales and with targets, indicators and time frames. These strategies should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience. The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG report A/71/644). The relevant SDG indicators reflect the Sendai Framework indicators.","graph_title":"Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies","indicator_name":"Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies","data_non_statistical":false,"target_name":"By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters","title":"Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Office for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_1":"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/23432Rwanda_VNR_Document__Final.pdf","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_earliest_available_1":2017,"source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"Ministry in Charge of Emergency Management (MINEMA)","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","source_statistical_classification_1":"Administrative","source_contact_1":"http://www.minema.gov.rw/index.php?id=108","source_other_info_1":"info@midimar.gov.rw","source_url_text_1":"Rwanda VNR Report","computation_units":"Number","national_indicator_description":"An open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework.
