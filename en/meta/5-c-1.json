[The Organic Law N\u00b0 002/2022.OL of 12/12/2022 on Public Finance Management](https://www.minecofin.gov.rw/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=58910&token=bc04f1809e0561845afb69ecd1d4e8d340cb845d) reinforces this commitment in the article 34 by requiring the integration of gender considerations in public finance processes.\n    One of the essential tools in this effort is the Gender Budget Statement (GBS), which is submitted to Parliament alongside the Finance Law. These statements ensure that public resources are allocated to programs and initiatives that address gender disparities and promote women's empowerment in areas such as education, health, and economic opportunities. By institutionalizing GRB, Rwanda continues to lead by example in leveraging public finance to achieve gender equality and inclusive development. This approach reflects the country's dedication to aligning its budgeting process with its broader goals for sustainable and equitable growth.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2024-12-31","goal_number":"5","target_number":"5.c","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"05-0c-01"}
