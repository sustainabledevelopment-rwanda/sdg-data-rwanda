In the OECD classification the term \"taxes\" is defined as compulsory unrequited payments to general government. The definition of government follows that of the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). The important parts of the SNA's conceptual framework and its definitions of the various sectors of the economy have been reflected in the OECD's classification of taxes. The data are predominantly recorded on an accrual basis. Data on tax revenues are recorded without offsets for the administrative expenses connected with tax collection. GDP also follows the definition used in the SNA. The methodology used in compiling the OECD's internally comparable revenue statistics has been carefully developed and refined through consultation with national statisticians and tax policy makers for more than 40 years. It continues to evolve.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/b3b2522c0eba85e20fa291f8b8fe20244c6038de","goal_number":"17","target_number":"17.1","indicator":"17.1.1","target_id":"17.1","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"17-01-01"}
