Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural       influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ   measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical   and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major         impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to       sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater     bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator     6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring     data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of     water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies,       expressed as a percentage.","data_non_statistical":false,"target_name":"By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally","title":"Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality","un_custodian_agency":"UNEP","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_statistical_classification_1":"Not-Official","source_contact_1":"info@rwb.rw","source_other_info_1":"https://www.rwb.rw/","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_earliest_available_1":"2017","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"Rwanda Water Resource Board (RWB)","source_release_date_1":"TBD","source_next_release_1":"TBD","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","national_indicator_available":"Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-19","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-19: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/cef82cc959c4808aa85c4cbf8f23dadd822d4428","goal_number":"6","target_number":"6.3","indicator":"6.3.2","target_id":"6.3","sdg_goal":"6","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"06-03-02"},"6-5-2":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-6.pdf ","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","graph_title":"Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation","graph_type":"line","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","indicator_definition":"Proportion of surface area of transboundary basins that have an operational arrangement for transboundary water cooperation.

Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.","indicator_name":"Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities","target_name":"By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value","title":"Unemployment rate, by sex","un_custodian_agency":"International labour organization (ILO)","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Labour Force Survey (LFS)","source_organisation_1":"National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2016","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","source_url_1":"http://www.statistics.gov.rw/datasource/labour-force-survey-0","source_release_date_1":2019,"source_next_release_1":2020,"source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"http://www.statistics.gov.rw/","source_other_info_1":"info@statistics.gov.rw","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Population and Housing Census","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","national_indicator_available":"Unemployment rate, by sex, and by residence","computation_definitions":"Is the percentage of persons in the labour force who are unemployed.","national_indicator_description":"Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age (usually persons aged 15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity, where; (a) \u201cnot in employment\u201d is assessed with respect to the short reference period for the measurement of employment; (b) to \u201cseek employment\u201d refers to any activity when carried out, during a specified recent period comprising the last four weeks or one month, for the purpose of finding a job or setting up a business or agricultural undertaking; (c) the point when the enterprise starts to exist should be used to distinguish between search activities aimed at setting up a business and the work activity itself, as evidenced by the enterprise\u2019s registration to operate or by when financial resources become available, the necessary infrastructure or materials are in place or the first client or order is received, depending on the context; (d) \u201ccurrently available\u201d serves as a test of readiness to start a job in the present, assessed with respect to a short reference period comprising that used to measure employment (depending on national circumstances, the reference period may be extended to include a short subsequent period not exceeding two weeks in total, so as to ensure adequate coverage of unemployment situations among different population groups).","computation_disaggregation":"National, Residence (Urban, Rural), sex, age group, Marital Status, Educational Attainment, Persons with disabilities.","computation_calculations":"(Unemployed persons / Persons in labour force) * 100","comments_limitations":"In Rwanda the working age group is 16 years old and over unlike international standard which is 15 years and above.","graph_title":"Unemployment rate","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-02-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-02-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/2681c507c601f652caf30eebd76f46acc23d97f0","goal_number":"8","target_number":"8.5","indicator":"8.5.2","target_id":"8.5","sdg_goal":"8","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"08-05-02"},"8-6-1":{"indicator_number":"8.6.1","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-08-06-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 894kB)","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Youth not in employment and not education or training","indicator_name":"Proportion of youth (aged 15\u201324 years) not in education, employment or training","indicator_definition":"This indicator is defined as the percentage of young persons (aged 15-24 years) not in education, employment or training, out of the total youth population.

Child labour is a legal concept rather than a statistical one, and the international legal standards that define it are therefore the necessary frame of reference for child labour statistics. The three principal international conventions on child labour \u2013 ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) (C138), ILO Convention No. 182 (Worst Forms) (C182), and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), together set the legal boundaries for child labour, and provide the legal basis for national and international actions against it. In accordance with the Resolution, and on the basis of the production boundary set by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), child labour is defined for measurement purposes to include all persons aged 5 to 17 years who are engaged in one or more of the following activities during a specified time period; (a) hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 21 to 32); (b) worst forms of child labour other than hazardous work (18th ICLS, paragraphs 33 to 34); and (c) employment below the minimum working age, excluding, where applicable, \u201clight work\u201d, performed by children aged not less than 12 or 13 years (18th ICLS, paragraphs 35 to 37). If, depending upon national policies and circumstances, the general production boundary rather than the SNA production boundary is used for measuring productive activities by children, child labour will include, in addition to these three categories, hazardous unpaid household services. For the sake of clarity, child labour estimated on this basis should be called \u201cchild labour (general production boundary basis)\u201d. The measurement methodology used by the ILO in its global estimates on child labour, 1 building on the ICLS statistical definition, classifies child labour on the basis of the following criteria; (a) Ages 5 to 11; at least 1 hour of economic activity per week; (b) Ages 12 to 14; at least 14 hour of economic activity per week in all forms of economic activity except permissible \u201clight\u201d work, where light work is operationally defined as economic activity that (i) does not exceed 14 hours per week and that (ii) is not hazardous in nature; and (c) Ages 15 to 17; work in designated hazardous industries, or in designated hazardous occupations, or for long hours.

Tax burden; Revenue in the form of taxes as defined under government finance statistics (GFS) code 11 as a share of total revenue. In GFS, taxes are classified into six major categories; (i) taxes on income, profits, and capital gains; (ii) taxes on payroll and workforce; (iii) taxes on property; (iv) taxes on goods and services; (v) taxes on international trade and transactions; and (vi) other taxes. (Source; IMF, Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014), Table 4A.1, assessed Dec 28 2015) Concepts Tax burden concept may be disaggregated into the complementary concepts of; \"direct taxes\" or taxes that take into account individual circumstances of taxpayers (e.g., taxes on individual and corporate income), which can be calculated from the following detailed GFS revenue classifications; 111 Taxes on income, profits, and capital gains+1131 Recurrent taxes on immovable property+1132 Recurrent taxes on net wealth+1136 Other recurrent taxes on property; and \"indirect taxes\" or taxes that do not take into account individual circumstances of taxpayers (e.g., taxes imposed on goods and services), which can be calculated from the following detailed GFS revenue classifications 112 Taxes on payroll and workforce+114 Taxes on goods and services+115 Taxes on international trade and transactions+116 Other taxes. Tax burden is directly related to the wider concept of fiscal burden, which can be derived from combining two GFSM 2014 revenue codes; code 11 Taxes plus code 12, Social Contributions or, alternatively 11+121+122. These concepts can also be found in the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). The coverage, timing, and valuation of tax revenue in GFSM 2014 and the 2008 SNA are identical, but the classification systems differ. The 2008 SNA classifies taxes according to their role in economic activities'namely; (i) taxes on production and imports (D2); (ii) current taxes on income, wealth, etc. (D5); and (iii) capital taxes (D91). The result is that some categories of taxes in GFS need to be allocated between two of the SNA tax categories according to whether they are payable by producers or final consumers, or whether they are current or capital taxes. A detailed description of the linkages between the GFS and the 2008 SNA categories of taxes is provided in Appendix 7 of the GFSM 2014.","computation_calculations":"The Proportion of domestic budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes will is calculated as (Domestic Taxes / Expenditure) expressed as a percentage.","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/b93e764f2f032aec0d2df31ba383bc82dfd4f1ba","goal_number":"17","target_number":"17.1","indicator":"17.1.2","target_id":"17.1","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"17-01-02"},"17-3-2":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":true,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-17-03-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 468kB)","graph_title":"","graph_type":"line","indicator_number":"17.3.2","indicator_name":"Volume of remittances (in United States dollars) as a proportion of total GDP","permalink":"/17-3-2/","sdg_goal":"17","source_active_1":true,"ource_earliest_available_1":2015,"source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"National Bank of Rwanda (BNR)","source_release_date_1":2019,"source_next_release_1":2020,"source_statistical_classification_1":"Not Official","source_contact_1":"info@bnr.rw","source_other_info_1":"https://www.bnr.rw/home/","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_name":"Mobilize additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources","title":"Volume of remittances (in United States dollars) as a proportion of total GDP","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank","computation_units":"USD","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","national_indicator_available":"Volume of remittances (in United States dollars) as a proportion of total GDP ","national_indicator_periodicity":"Annual","un_designated_tier":"I","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/b20378692debbb9962a51cb67b68a01e3f555175","goal_number":"17","target_number":"17.3","indicator":"17.3.2","target_id":"17.3","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"17-03-02"},"17-4-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-17-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 468kB)","graph_title":"Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and services","graph_type":"line","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","indicator_number":"17.4.1","indicator_name":"Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and services","indicator_definition":"Debt service as proportion of exports of goods and services is the percentage of debt services (principle and interest payments) to the exports of goods and services.
