The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. The     assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women\u2019s Machinery     (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 45 yes/no questions under four areas   of law; (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and       (iv) marriage and family . The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender         equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States     parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non-discrimination on     the basis of sex was needed. The primary sources of information relevant for indicator 5.1.1 are legislation and policy/action plans.","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"MINISTRY OF JUSTICE (MINIJUST)","source_contact_1":"mjust@minijust.gov.rw","source_other_info_1":"https://www.minijust.gov.rw/","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-statistical indicator","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_name":"End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere","title":"Whether or not legal frameworks are in place to promote, enforce and monitor equality and non\u2011discrimination on the basis of sex","un_custodian_agency":"UN Women,World Bank,OECD Development Centre","un_designated_tier":"Tier III","page_content":"**Non-statistical indicator**\n\n**Existing legal framework:**\n\n  - [The Constitution of Republic of Rwanda of 2003 revised in 2015](https://www.parliament.gov.rw/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=73646&token=31d8f8f1eb806040f89b6cb3bc02f44ea13a2aee) enshrines the principle of Gender equality and women\u2019s rights and provides the minimum 30% quota for women in all decision making positions and Prohibits all kind of discrimination; \n\n  - [Organic Law governing elections](https://nec.gov.rw/fileadmin/user_upload/Electoral_acts/Itegeko_Ngenga_rigeanga_amatora_29_07_2019.pdf) was enacted as an additional legislation promoting gender parity in decision making structures of the government.
