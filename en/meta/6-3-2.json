Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural       influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ   measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical   and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major         impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to       sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater     bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator     6.3.2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring     data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of     water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 % compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies,       expressed as a percentage.","data_non_statistical":false,"target_name":"By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally","title":"Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality","un_custodian_agency":"UNEP","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_statistical_classification_1":"Not-Official","source_contact_1":"info@rwb.rw","source_other_info_1":"https://www.rwb.rw/","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_earliest_available_1":"2017","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"Rwanda Water Resource Board (RWB)","source_release_date_1":"TBD","source_next_release_1":"TBD","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","national_indicator_available":"Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-19","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-19: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/cef82cc959c4808aa85c4cbf8f23dadd822d4428","goal_number":"6","target_number":"6.3","indicator":"6.3.2","target_id":"6.3","sdg_goal":"6","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"06-03-02"}
