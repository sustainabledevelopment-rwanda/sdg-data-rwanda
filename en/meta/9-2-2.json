This indicator conveys the contribution of manufacturing in total employment. It measures the ability of the manufacturing sector to absorb surplus labour forces from agricultural and other traditional sectors towards production labour with higher wages, when monitored over time. However, in developed countries an opposite trend is expected where emphasis has shifted to reduction in labor in manufacturing as part of cost-cutting measures, to promote more capital-intensive industries.","graph_title":"Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment","indicator_name":"Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment","data_non_statistical":false,"target_name":"Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry\u2019s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries","title":"Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Labour Force Survey (LFS)","source_url_1":"http://www.statistics.gov.rw/datasource/labour-force-survey-0","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","source_earliest_available_1":"2017","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR)","source_release_date_1":2019,"source_next_release_1":2020,"source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statistics.gov.rw","source_other_info_1":"http://www.statistics.gov.rw/","source_active_2":true,"source_url_text_2":"GDP National Accounts","source_url_2":"http://www.statistics.gov.rw/statistical-publications/subject/gdp-calendar-year-publications","source_geographical_coverage_2":"Rwanda","source_earliest_available_2":"2017","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_organisation_2":"National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR)","source_release_date_2":2019,"source_next_release_2":2020,"source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@statistics.gov.rw","source_other_info_2":"http://www.statistics.gov.rw/","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"computation_units":"Percentage (%)","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","national_indicator_available":"Employed in industry","computation_definitions":"It is the share of manufacturing employment in total employment","computation_calculations":"(Total employment in manufacturing activities / Total employment in all economic activities) * 100","national_indicator_description":"The sectors of economic activity are defined according to the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Revision 3 (1990) and Revision 4 (2008).
