Death defines as the number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event. Missing defines as the number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead, for whom there is no physical evidence such as a body, and for which an official/legal report has been filed with competent authorities. Directly affected defines as the number of people who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected are people who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time, due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructure, basic services, commerce or work, or social, health and psychological consequences.","graph_title":"DISASTER EFFECTS SITUATION","indicator_name":"Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population","data_non_statistical":false,"target_name":"By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations","title":"DISASTER EFFECTS SITUATION","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Office for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","data_show_map":false,"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"http://minema.gov.rw/index.php?id=107","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_1":"http://minema.gov.rw/index.php?id=107","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_earliest_available_1":"2018","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_organisation_1":"Ministry in Charge of Emergency Management (MINEMA)","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Data on Disaster Effects","computation_units":"Number","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-10-21: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/0c92a32d6a65e51120b52ca80a9c731d20d3a23c","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-02-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/2681c507c601f652caf30eebd76f46acc23d97f0","page_content":"","goal_number":"11","target_number":"11.5","indicator":"11.5.1","target_id":"11.5","reporting_status":"notstarted","indicator_sort_order":"11-05-01"}
