This aligns with Rwanda\u2019s broader environmental policies and strategies to ensure sustainable development.\n\nKey Actions and Policies Supporting Compliance:\n\n- [National Environment and Climate Change Policy (2019)](https://rdb.rw/eia/Rwanda_National_Environment_and_Climate_Change_Policy.pdf). This policy provides a framework to regulate and manage hazardous waste and chemicals, ensuring compliance with international conventions, including the Basel Convention. It emphasizes the need for integrated waste management systems and proper disposal mechanisms for hazardous materials.\n\n- [Law on Environment](https://waterportal.rwb.rw/sites/default/files/2018-10/Water%20law%20gazetted%2C2018.pdf). This law prohibits the importation, production, and disposal of hazardous waste without prior authorization, reinforcing Rwanda\u2019s obligations under the Basel Convention. It also sets penalties for non-compliance, ensuring robust enforcement mechanisms.\n\n- [National Strategy for Climate Change and Low Carbon Development (Green Growth Strategy)](https://www.rema.gov.rw/fileadmin/user_upload/Rwanda_Green_Growth___Climate_Resilience_Strategy_06102022.pdf). This strategy advocates for environmentally sound management of waste and the promotion of green technologies to reduce hazardous waste generation.\nSource\n\n- [The Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA)](https://www.rema.gov.rw/home) is tasked with implementing and monitoring compliance with the Basel Convention. REMA works closely with other agencies to control the transboundary movement of hazardous waste and prevent illegal trafficking. Rwanda also complies with the Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, ensuring a comprehensive approach to managing hazardous chemicals and waste. These synergies strengthen the country's capacity to address waste and chemical management challenges effectively.\n\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2024-12-31","goal_number":"12","target_number":"12.4","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"12-04-01"}
