This integration ensures that global priorities, such as poverty reduction, education, healthcare, and climate resilience, are tailored to the country\u2019s specific needs and reflected in actionable programs. Localization efforts extend this alignment to the district level, fostering decentralized implementation and community involvement in achieving sustainable development.\n\nIn 2023, Rwanda published the second [Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs)](https://hlpf.un.org/countries/rwanda) and it have been instrumental in monitoring Rwanda\u2019s progress. The VNRs emphasize inclusivity through multi-stakeholder engagement and provide a platform for assessing challenges and opportunities in meeting SDG targets.\n\nSupporting these efforts, the [National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS)](https://www.statistics.gov.rw/publication/nsds3) ensures that policy decisions are data-driven. These mechanisms highlight Rwanda\u2019s commitment to sustainable development through cohesive planning, monitoring, and evidence-based decision-making.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2024-12-31","goal_number":"17","target_number":"17.14","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"17-14-01"}
