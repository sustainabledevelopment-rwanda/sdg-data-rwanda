Areas under reforestation that have not yet reached but are expected to reach a tree height of 5 metres and canopy cover of 10 per cent are included, as are temporarily unstocked areas, resulting from human intervention or natural causes, which are expected to regenerate. Also included are; areas with bamboo and palms, provided that height and canopy cover criteria are met; forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest; windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.25 hectares and width of more than 20 metres; and plantations primarily used for forestry or protective purposes, such as rubber-wood plantations . Forest area excludes land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use, such as tree stands in agricultural production systems (e.g. fruit plantations and agroforestry systems), and trees in urban parks and gardens. Land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes.","computation_disaggregation":"By type of forest species.","computation_calculations":"(Total area of forest / Total land area) * 100","graph_title":"Forest area as a proportion of total land area","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-28","goal_number":"15","target_number":"15.1","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"15-01-01"}
