These frameworks align with the principles of sustainable development, emphasizing the integration of biodiversity into sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and infrastructure development. The inclusion of biodiversity considerations in [Rwanda's National Environment and Climate Change Policy](https://rdb.rw/eia/Rwanda_National_Environment_and_Climate_Change_Policy.pdf) is particularly significant. This policy underscores the importance of maintaining ecosystem services for economic resilience and social well-being.\n\nRwanda has also developed the [National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP)](https://rema.gov.rw/fileadmin/templates/Documents/rema_doc/publications/Planning%20docs/NATIONAL%20BIODIVERSITY%20STRATEGY%20AND%20ACTION%20PLAN%20Final%20version.pdf), which directly responds to the Aichi Targets. The NBSAP incorporates strategic actions aimed at valuing and conserving biodiversity while promoting sustainable use and equitable benefit-sharing. It has encouraged cross-sectoral collaboration, with initiatives such as ecosystem valuation studies and the integration of biodiversity indicators into national accounting systems.\n\nFurthermore, [Rwanda's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)](https://www.mininfra.gov.rw/fileadmin/user_upload/Mininfra/Documents/Housing_and_Urban_Planning_Docs/Environmental_and_Social_Impact_Assessment_Final_Report.pdf) guidelines mandate biodiversity considerations in project planning and implementation. Through these mechanisms, biodiversity values are increasingly recognized and factored into decision-making processes.\n","goal_number":"15","target_number":"15.9","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"15-09-01"}
