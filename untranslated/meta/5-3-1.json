Numerator is the Number of women (or men) married by specific exact ages (15, 18, 20, 22, 25) includes women (or men) first in a marriage or consensual union before earlier specific ages, e.g. the number of women (or men) who married before age 18 includes those who married before age 15. Women (or men) who have never married nor lived in a consensual union are included in a separate category. Denominator is the Number of women (or men) of all marital statuses. In ever-married samples, the denominator is adjusted by the all-woman (or man) factors. Denominator for cohort must exclude women who have not yet reached the oldest age of the specific age category.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-15","goal_number":"5","target_number":"5.3","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"05-03-01"}
