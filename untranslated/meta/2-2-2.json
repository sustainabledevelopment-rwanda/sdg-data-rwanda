Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child nutritional status. Child wasting refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Child wasting is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.","indicator_number":"2.2.2","indicator_name":"global_indicators.2-2-2-title","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR)","source_periodicity_1":"3-5 years","source_earliest_available_1":1992,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Rwanda","source_url_1":"http://www.statistics.gov.rw/datasource/demographic-and-health-survey-dhs","source_url_text_1":"Rwanda Demographic Health Survey (RDHS)","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_name":"global_targets.2-2-title","title":"Prevalence of malnutrition among children under 5 years of age, by type","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)","computation_definitions":"Is the percentage of children under five years old whose weight for height are less than minus two standards deviations (wasting) and above than plus two standards deviations (overweight) from the median weight for height of the reference population ages 0\u201359 months.
