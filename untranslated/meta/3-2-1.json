Interviewed women may omit births and deaths or include stillbirths along with live births. Survey data may also suffer from survivor selection bias and age truncation. Mothers may misreport their children\u2019s birth dates, current ages or ages at death perhaps more so if the child has died. The heaping of deaths at age 12 months is especially common. Age heaping may transfer deaths across the one year boundary and lead to underestimates of infant mortality rates. Fortunately, it has little effect on under five mortality rates, which makes the U5MR a more robust estimate than the infant mortality rate when data are drawn from household surveys.","computation_calculations":"(Number of deaths of infants (<5yr of age) in the last 5 years before the survey / Total number of live births in 5 years before the survey)* 1000","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-14","goal_number":"3","target_number":"3.2","reporting_status":"complete","indicator_sort_order":"03-02-01"}
