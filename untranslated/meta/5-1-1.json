The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender         equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States     parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non-discrimination on     the basis of sex was needed.
