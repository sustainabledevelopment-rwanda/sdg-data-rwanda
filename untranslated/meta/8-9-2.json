Tourism characteristic activities are the activities that typically produce tourism characteristic products. Tourism characteristic products are those that satisfy one or both of the following criteria; (a) Tourism expenditure on the product (either good or service) should represent a significant share of total tourism expenditure (share-of-expenditure/demand condition); (b) Tourism expenditure on the product should represent a significant share of the supply of the product in the economy (share-of-supply condition). This criterion implies that the supply of a tourism characteristic product would cease to exist in meaningful quantity in the absence of visitors.","computation_calculations":"(Numbe employed person in tourism industries / Total employment)","national_geographical_coverage":"Rwanda","computation_disaggregation":"National, Residence (Urban/Rural), Sex","indicator_sort_order":"08-09-02","page_content":"No data for this indicator is currently available and its methodology is still under development.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-10-21: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sustainabledevelopment-rwanda/sdg-data-rwanda/commit/d9ad6f147e47f8bfc017fd1cc671d45283aecb69","reporting_status":"notstarted"}
