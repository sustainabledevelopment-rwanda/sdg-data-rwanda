indicator_number: 5.1.1
indicator_name: "Whether or not legal frameworks are in place to promote, enforce and monitor equality and non discrimination on the basis of sex"
indicator_definition: Indicator 5.1.1 measures Government efforts to put in place legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor       gender equality. The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. The     assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women’s Machinery     (NWMs), and legal practitioners/researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 45 yes/no questions under four areas   of law; (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life; (ii) violence against women; (iii) employment and economic benefits; and       (iv) marriage and family . The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy framework on gender         equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States     parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non-discrimination on     the basis of sex was needed. The primary sources of information relevant for indicator 5.1.1 are legislation and policy/action plans.
