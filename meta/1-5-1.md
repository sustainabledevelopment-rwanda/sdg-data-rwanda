indicator_definition: This indicator measures the number of people who died, went missing or were directly affected by disasters per 100,000 population. Death defines as the number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event. Missing defines as the number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead, for whom there is no physical evidence such as a body, and for which an official/legal report has been filed with competent authorities. Directly affected defines as the number of people who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected are people who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time, due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructure, basic services, commerce or work, or social, health and psychological consequences.

national_indicator_description: Death is explained as the number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event. Missing is explained as the number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead, for whom there is no physical evidence such as a body, and for which an official/legal report has been filed with competent authorities. Directly affected is explained as the number of people who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected are people who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time, due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructure, basic services, commerce or work, or social, health and psychological consequences.
computation_calculations: This indicator is calculated using the relevant total figures (deaths; injured and missing persons) from national disaster loss databases, divided by the national population (or population projection) for the corresponding year, and multiplied by 100,000.
