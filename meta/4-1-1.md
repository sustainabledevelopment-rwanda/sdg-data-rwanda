national_indicator_description: The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative to new common reading and mathematics scales currently in development
computation_calculations: 'The indicator is calculated as the percentage of children and/or young people at the relevant stage of education achieving or exceeding a pre-defined proficiency level in a given subject. Performance above the minimum level, PLtn,s, above minimum = p where p is the percentage of students in a learning assessment at stage of education n, in subject s in any year (t-i) where 0 < i < 5, who has achieved the level of proficiency that is greater than a pre-defined minimum standard, Smin. The minimum standard is defined by the global education community taking into consideration regional differences.'
