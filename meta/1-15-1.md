indicator_definition: TGDP per capita is the gross domestic product divided by total population. Gross Domestic Product is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy measured as the difference between production and intermediate consumption plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. GDP data are reported in RWF both in current and constant prices. GDP in constant RWF prices is calculated using fixed prices of a designated base year (2014) thus factoring out the effects of inflation and allowing easy comparison; this GDP is also known as Real GDP. These   statistics   provide   key   information   on   the   structure and development of the economy.
