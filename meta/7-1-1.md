national_indicator_available: Proportion (%) of Households with access to electricity
computation_definitions: It is the number of households who use electricity as their main source for lighting to the total number of households expressed as a percentage.
computation_calculations: (Number of households who declared using electricity as their main source for lighting / Total number of urban households) * 100
