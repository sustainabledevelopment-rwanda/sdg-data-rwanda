graph_title: 'Prevalence of malnutrition among children under 5 years of age, by type'
graph_type: line
indicator_definition: Prevalence of wasting (weight for height <-2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age. Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child nutritional status. Child wasting refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Child wasting is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.
indicator: 2.2.2
indicator_name: Prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or <-2 standard deviation from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age, by type (wasting and overweight)

target_name: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the
  internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years
  of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating
  women and older persons

computation_definitions: Is the percentage of children under five years old whose weight for height are less than minus two standards deviations (wasting) and above than plus two standards deviations (overweight) from the median weight for height of the reference population ages 0–59 months. The nutritional status of children in the survey population was compared with the 2006 WHO Child Growth Standards (WHO, 2006)
