national_indicator_description: The quality of service delivery refers to a customer’s comparison of service expectations as it relates to actual performance. Institutions that offer high-quality services endeavor to match or exceed customer expectations. The Quality of Service Delivery pillar emphasizes the need for efficiency and effectiveness in meeting citizens' needs. Ensuring effective service delivery is a fundamental obligation of all service providers. In Rwanda Governance Scorecard, Quality of service delivery follows the government of Rwanda clusters, namely local governance and justice sectors, social sector (health and education) as well as economic sector which includes land, agricultural and infrastructural sectors.
computation_calculations: Rwanda Governance Scorecard employs advanced research methods in global governance contextualized to national realities. It builds on global indicators customized to the local context and relies on a wealth of new local data, including citizen’s surveys, and secondary data. The uniqueness of RGS is that it generates data from a wide range of recent country-specific data sources. Due to the nature and periodicity of some of the data sources, some data can be used for more than one year for example data from EICV, RDHS, RPHC, results from elections, and other studies with periodicity of more than one year. The collected data is analyzed using scoring methods in which pillar values are compiled based on the performance of relevant indicators and variables. RGB ensures that data quality is maintained throughout the data gathering and scoring processes. It is disaggregation by sub-indicators (Service Delivery in Local Administration, Service delivery in Justice Sector, Service Delivery in Social Sector, Service delivery in Economic Sector).
