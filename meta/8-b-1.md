[Rwanda’s National Employment Policy (NEP)](https://webapps.ilo.org/static/english/emplab/download/nep/rwanda/rwanda_national_employment_policy_2019.pdf) is a key instrument in achieving the ambitious goals outlined in the National Strategy for Transformation. Prioritize job creation as a cornerstone for inclusive growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable development.

Under the framework of the [first National Strategy for Transformation (NST1 2017-2024)](https://www.minecofin.gov.rw/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=12464&token=206d23b5640d50ee08ce4db3a852e5f60f9902ed), the NEP focused on addressing unemployment and underemployment, especially among youth and women, by promoting [skills development, entrepreneurship, and private-sector growth](https://rdb.rw/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NSDEPS.pdf). This effort was aligned with policies such as the [Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Policy](https://ipar.org.rw/fileadmin/publications/Policy%20Directory/Social/Education/TVET%20Policy%202015.pdf) and the [Made in Rwanda Policy](https://rwandatrade.rw/media/2017%20MINICOM%20Made%20in%20Rwanda%20Policy%20(1).pdf), which aimed to build a skilled workforce and support industrialization to boost job creation.

As Rwanda transitions to[the second National Strategy for Transformation (NST2 2024-2029)](https://www.minecofin.gov.rw/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=112651&token=0d37e3b2e0b33ca65ec4fcc88d0c86132b3e6056), the NEP remains central to achieving the vision of a high-income economy by 2050. The policy emphasizes the creation of decent and productive jobs in sectors such as ICT, manufacturing, and the green economy, guided by the [National Skills Development and Employment Promotion Strategy (NSDEPS)](https://rdb.rw/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NSDEPS.pdf). It also highlights inclusive employment strategies to ensure that vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities and women, benefit equitably from economic growth opportunities.
