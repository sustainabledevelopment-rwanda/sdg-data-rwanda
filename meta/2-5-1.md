target_name: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed
  and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly
  managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international
  levels, and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising

computation_definitions: The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long-term conservation facilities (ex situ in genebanks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm. The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm. The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted. 
computation_calculations: Plant genetic resources; The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long-term conditions, where an ‘accession’ is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Animal genetic resources; The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to reconstitute the breed.
