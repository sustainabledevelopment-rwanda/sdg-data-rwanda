graph_title: 'Neonatal mortality rate'
graph_type: line
indicator: 3.2.2
indicator_definition: Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life.

target_name: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births

national_indicator_available: Neonatal mortality rate 
computation_definitions: It Is the probability of a child born alive in a specified period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period.
national_indicator_description: The time reference of NMR is not the year in which the survey is undertaken; rather it is the five years’ period preceding the survey date. Hence, if an exact time point is needed as a time reference, it must be taken as the mid of the five-year interval preceding the survey date. 
computation_disaggregation: National, Province, District Residence (Urban & Rural), Sex, Socio-economic characteristics of mothers (education, wealth quintiles)
computation_calculations: (Number of deaths of infants (<28 days) in the last 5 years before the survey / Total number of Live births in 5 years before the survey)* 1000
