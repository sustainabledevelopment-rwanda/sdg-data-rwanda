graph_title: 'Gender parity indices'
graph_type: line
computation_units: Indice 
indicator_number: 4.5.1
indicator_name: Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintile and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected,as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be disaggregated
indicator_definition: Parity indices require data for the specific groups of interest. They represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups

national_indicator_available: <p>- Gender Parity Index in primary level enrolment</p><p>- Gender Parity Index in Secondary level enrolment
national_indicator_definition: Gender Parity Index (GPI) in primary/ secondary level enrolment is the ratio between the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of girls and that of boys in primary education.
national_indicator_description: Parity indices require data for the specific groups of interest. They represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.
national_indicator_periodicity: 3 Years
national_computation_method: <p>The GPI is calculated by dividing the female GER by the male GER for primary/ Secondary education</p><p> To calculate the GER it is first necessary to determine the official school age population for each level of education</p><p>Then, the number of students enrolled in primary education is divided by the official school age population for primary education, and the result is multiplied by 100. GERs for boys and girls are calculated separately</p>
target_name: By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access
  to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including
  persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations
